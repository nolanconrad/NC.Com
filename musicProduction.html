                <h2>Fresh, New Music</h2>
                <p>Nolan Conrad is an American artist from Corona, CA. Working out of his bedroom studio, he looks to innovate and change the game, rather than go along with it. </p>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Conrad discovered his passion for music production after being gifted a small MIDI keyboard for Christmas in 2019. Discovering the world of digital audio production, he was amazed at the possibilites that were previously not possible. With any instrument now digitally availible at his fingertips, Nolan is constantly inspired to create epic sounds, songs, and scores, in a variety of different genres.</p>
